# Valentine's Anti-Romance Movies
ðŸ–¤ðŸ’”

## Goal
As a frequent movie-goer, I got a hunch that this year's Valentine's Day movies were darker than previous years. Why? Read [my article](https://tiff-xwang.github.io/valentines-movies/) to find out. I set out to find solid proof on this hunch of mine. 

## Data & Workflow
I scraped Box Office Mojo for movies released between the beginning of February and February 14th during the past 10 years, and I saved the result to [valentines_movies.xlsx](valentines_movies.xlsx).
<br></br>
Then, I went in the Excel to manually pick out [love_movies.csv](love_movies.csv).
